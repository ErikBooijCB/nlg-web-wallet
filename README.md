# Gulden Web Wallet
This application provides a simple to use interface to a Gulden node, available in your browser. If you are, for instance, running a Gulden node on a Raspberry Pi in order to take part in [witnessing](https://gulden.com/pow2), this application will allow you to maintain your wallet with ease, while providing insights into your witnessing proceeds.
